This is a Troxy recording file.
You can modify this file in your editor of choice, but there are some rules you must follow:
* All fields except "COMMENT", "HEADER" and "CONTENT" must stay in one line.
* Everything after "=" for the fields will be included (text won't be trimmed), this includes whitespace.
* The "[COMMENT<_END>]", "[HEADER<_END>]" and "[CONTENT<_END>]" markers must be the only text on their lines.
* If the comment contains "[COMMENT_END]", this must be escaped as "[[COMMENT_END]]".
* If the header contains "[HEADER_END]", this must be escaped as "[[HEADER_END]]".
* If the content contains "[CONTENT_END]", this must be escaped as "[[CONTENT_END]]".
* Any text outside a field will be ignored, and erased if recording is modified in the user interface.
